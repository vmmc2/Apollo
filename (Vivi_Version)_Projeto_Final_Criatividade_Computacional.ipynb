        "    * Apollo é uma ferramenta simples para geração de Singles (ou melhor dizendo, 'sneak peeks' de 30 segundos de um Single) que segue as instruções fornecidas pelo usuário.\n",
        "    * Basta fornecer algumas entradas específicas, explicadas abaixo, e, ao final do processo, você obterá o Single como resultado e poderá baixá-lo.\n",

        "    * __Imagem que representa a vibe do Single:__ Uma imagem que será usada para extrair o \"sentimento geral\" que o Single deseja transmitir para o público.\n",
        "    * __Descrição musical do Single:__ Uma descrição textual individual a respeito do Single a ser gerado. Aqui, o usuário tem total liberdade para descrever como quer que uma faixa específica do álbum seja. O usuário pode descrever o uso de instrumentos musicais, a maneira como os intrumentos devem ser tocados, a intensidade e ritmo de cada um. Além disso, pode citar influências de gêneros musicais, artistas, bandas. O limite é a sua imaginação! E, lembre-se, quanto mais detalhado, melhor!\n",
